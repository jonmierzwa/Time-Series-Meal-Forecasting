# Time-Series-Meal-Forecasting
- Objective: Build Recurrent Neural Networks in an effort to forecast future demand of specific meal types.
- Dataset: Meal data taken from Kaggle site, consisting of more than 400,000 entries.
- Approach: Load in train/test data, EDA, data cleaning, model building, evaluate performance, and generate forecast predictions. 
- Key Findings: The RNNs were very hit or miss for the different unique meal types being investigated. The quantified demand for specific meal types were very volatile, which gave the RNNs a more difficult time in predicting demand for the last 10 weeks of data and forecasting demand predictions.
